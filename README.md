# python-impedence-calculator

This is a small Python 3 tool designed to assist in the construction of impedence-matching networks.
It is CLI and allows for the calculation of pi, L, and other series-shunt networks.
Do not expect much from this program, as it was written mostly to help me get back into Python.

# Usage
Run the program with Python 3. `cmath` is required.
Follow the in-program prompts. Components are added from the input side to the output side, and are added in either series or shunt configuration.
There is no backspace or edit functionality. I advise that you do not make mistakes. (This may come in a future update).

# Changelog:
- v0.10: Initial "release." Does not do any actual calculation, purely data storage framework.
- v0.50: Early alpha. The program now has a function and does something. I'm not sure if it works, though.
- v0.60: Fixed a bunch of bugs and made the program work *correctly*. I hope.
- v0.70: Reorganize the program into separate files. Makes observing the program flow a little easier.
